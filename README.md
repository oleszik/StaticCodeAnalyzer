# StaticCodeAnalyzer
Python static code analyzer for PEP8-style checks. Scans a file or project directory, reports sorted violations with code+line, and supports rule sets from basic formatting to AST-based checks: naming of functions/args/local vars and mutable default arguments. Useful for linting practice and code quality automation.
